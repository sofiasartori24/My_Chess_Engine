# My_Chess_Engine
### README.md
Welcome to the **My Chess Engine** project! This repository is dedicated to the creation and optimization of a custom chess engine with the goal of increasing its Elo rating.

## Overview
This project aims to develop a robust and competitive chess engine using Python. The chess engine will initially focus on implementing fundamental chess mechanics and then progressively improve through optimization and advanced techniques.

## Project Goals
1. **Initial Development**:
   - Implement the basic rules of chess. (Currently I'm here)
   - Develop functions for legal move generation, board evaluation, and game state management.

2. **Optimization**:
   - Enhance the move generation logic for efficiency.
   - Implement various search algorithms such as Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, and more.
   - Improve the evaluation function to better assess board positions.

3. **Increasing Elo**:
   - Continuously test and benchmark the engine against other engines.
   - Analyze performance and make iterative improvements.
   - Utilize advanced techniques like machine learning to further enhance the engineâ€™s decision-making capabilities.

## Technologies
The primary technology stack for this project includes:
- **Python**: The main programming language for developing the chess engine.
- **Additional Libraries**: Libraries such as Pygame for the game interface, NumPy for numerical operations, and potentially machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch for advanced optimization.
